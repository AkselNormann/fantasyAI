AI for my Fantasy Premier League team.

## Background
2018-19 was my first season with Fantasy Premier League. I got a good score at very end. I have a considerable knowledge about the English Premier League but I feel that finding the best combination of the players is bit hard. So I decided to use league data to form a team that could give a tough fight to human managers.

So I wrote this AI over a weekend and let it take all the decisions on my behalf.

I am not so sure how would my AI perform but I have to try it once.
