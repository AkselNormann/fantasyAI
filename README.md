AI for my Fantasy Premier League team.

## Background
2018-19 was my first season with Fantasy Premier League. I got [good score at the end](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/4914864/history) because I was targetting for the Manager of the Week title and paid no respect to the transfers. Despite having considerable knowledge about the English Premier League I feel that being a manager in such a fickle game is bit hard. So for the season 2019-20, I decided to combine my programming skills and league data to form a team that could perform well overall.

## When my AI would be a winner
Last year, the manager who finished at the top got 2659 points (70 points/gameweek) and I got 1849 points (49 points/gameweek). So taking these parameters in mind, if my AI could get more than 2300 points or get in atleast top 10000, I would consider it a victory.
